have it so the user can hand draw the maze or choose to generate a random maze
then the user can find the shortest paths between two points

have a way to load in a custom maze from a file?

load data from a file too

when saving, get the file name that the user wants to save to

saving:
 - in the process of saving, we want to implement a method or <<operator with the cells to get the data for each cell that needs to be printed out similar to: 0 0 1 0 for the side connections
 - at the end of the file, save the marker locations?
